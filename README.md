# Azure & GitHub Certification Flashcards

High-quality, exam-realistic flashcards for Azure and GitHub certifications, designed for both Anki import and browser-based practice.

## Available Flashcard Decks

All source decks live in [flashcards](flashcards):

- AI-102: Microsoft Azure AI Engineer Associate
- AI-900: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals
- AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator
- AZ-204: Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure
- AZ-305: Designing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions
- AZ-500: Microsoft Azure Security Technologies
- GH-300: GitHub Foundations

## Features

- Browser practice website with exam selection
- Practice mode with immediate answer reveal
- Timed quiz mode with end-of-session scoring
- Domain and topic filtering
- Missed-question review stored locally in the browser
- Anki-compatible CSV source files for offline study

## Project Structure

- [flashcards](flashcards): source CSV decks
- [web](web): static React application for online practice
- [web/scripts/buildFlashcardData.mjs](web/scripts/buildFlashcardData.mjs): CSV-to-JSON build pipeline
- [.github/agents/flashcards_generator.agent.md](.github/agents/flashcards_generator.agent.md): Copilot flashcard generation agent

## Running the Website Locally

Prerequisites:

- Node.js 20+

Steps:

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev command automatically:

- reads the CSV decks from [flashcards](flashcards)
- selects the latest deck for each exam
- generates normalized JSON in [web/public/data](web/public/data)
- starts the Vite development server

## Building the Website

```bash
cd web
npm run build
```

This runs the data generation step first, then builds the static frontend.

## Website MVP Scope

The current website supports:

- exam selection
- practice mode
- timed quiz mode
- domain and topic filters
- review of missed questions
- local browser progress persistence with `localStorage`

Saved progress is device-local and does not sync across browsers or machines.

## Importing Flashcards into Anki

1. Download the CSV file for your desired certification from [flashcards](flashcards)
2. Open Anki and select or create a deck
3. Import the CSV file
4. Configure import settings:
   - Type: Basic, or a custom type with an Extra field
   - Fields separated by: comma
   - Field mapping:
     - Field 1 → Front
     - Field 2 → Back
     - Field 3 → Extra
     - Field 4 → Tags
   - Enable HTML rendering for fields

### Recommended Custom Note Type

To include the Extra field on the back of the card:

1. In Anki, open Tools → Manage Note Types
2. Add a clone of Basic
3. Add an Extra field
4. Update the back template:

```html
{{FrontSide}}

<hr id=answer>

{{Back}}

{{#Extra}}
<br><br>
<div style="color: #666; font-size: 90%; border-left: 3px solid #ccc; padding-left: 10px; margin-top: 15px;">
  <strong>Additional Insight:</strong><br>
  {{Extra}}
</div>
{{/Extra}}
```

## Generating New Flashcards

This repository includes a GitHub Copilot agent at [.github/agents/flashcards_generator.agent.md](.github/agents/flashcards_generator.agent.md).

Example prompts:

```text
@flashcards_generator Generate 20 flashcards for AZ-305 focusing on networking
@flashcards_generator Create flashcards for AZ-104 identity and governance
@flashcards_generator Generate 15 advanced difficulty flashcards for AZ-204
```

The agent will:

- research exam objectives
- generate diverse question sets
- create a CSV file named `{exam}_flashcards_{YYYY-MM-DD}.csv`
- include official Microsoft references when available

## Deployment

GitHub Pages deployment is defined in [.github/workflows/deploy-site.yml](.github/workflows/deploy-site.yml).

The workflow installs frontend dependencies, runs the CSV-to-JSON generation step, builds the site with the repository base path, and publishes the static output.
