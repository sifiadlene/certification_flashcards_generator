Your task: Generate high‑quality exam-realistic flashcards ANKI deck in CSV format.

## Input Parameters

- **Exam Certification**: Required (e.g., AZ-305, AZ-104, AZ-204)
- **Number of Flashcards**: Optional, default is 50 flashcards. If user specifies a number, generate that many flashcards.
- **Topic Focus**: Optional (e.g., "networking", "security", "identity")
- **Difficulty Level**: Optional (e.g., "intermediate", "advanced")

## Preparation Phase

1. **Extract Official Exam Topics First**:
  - Use only official Microsoft sources, starting with the Microsoft Learn certification exam page for the specified exam code
  - Extract all listed domains and "skills measured" subtopics from the official exam guide
  - Build a topic map that becomes the required coverage backbone for flashcard generation

2. **Create Topic-Driven Coverage Plan**:
  - Allocate flashcards across extracted domains proportionally to official exam weighting
  - If explicit weighting is unavailable, distribute proportionally by number of listed skills per domain
  - Keep questions in scope of extracted official topics unless the user explicitly asks for a narrow topic-only subset

3. **Reference Quality Examples**: Review `.github/agents/flashcard_examples.md` to apply quality standards after the topic map is finalized

## Flashcard Structure

Each flashcard must follow this CSV format:

**Front**: A clear, scenario-based question testing a single concept with three answer options (A, B, C)
- Include relevant constraints, requirements, and context
- Use realistic scenarios that mirror actual exam questions
- Format: Question text + `<br><br>` + three options separated by `<br>`

**Back**: A precise, technically accurate answer
- Single letter (A, B, or C) with the option text
- Brief justification explaining why it's correct
- Reference link to official Microsoft documentation (use format: `<br><br>Reference: <a href="URL">Link text</a>`)

**Extra**: Valuable insights beyond the answer (NOT optional - always provide)
- Compare alternatives: "X is for Y, while Z is for W"
- Explain why wrong answers fail: "Option A lacks [required feature]"
- Provide architectural insights or decision frameworks
- Include memory aids or key differentiators
- Reference related concepts or common pitfalls
- **Rule**: Extra field must go beyond restating the answer - provide architectural insight, comparisons, or deeper understanding

**Tags**: Format as `[Exam] [Domain] [Topic]` (e.g., "AZ-305 IdentityGovernance Authentication")

## Question Type Diversity

Generate diverse questions across these types (avoid repetitive patterns):

1. **Scenario-Based Design**: "A company needs X with requirements Y and Z. Which solution?"
2. **Feature Comparison**: "Compare services A, B, C for use case X"
3. **Troubleshooting**: "Application exhibits problem X. What's the cause/fix?"
4. **Best Practice**: "Which approach follows Azure Well-Architected Framework for scenario X?"
5. **Constraint Optimization**: "Minimize cost/maximize performance/ensure compliance while meeting requirements X, Y, Z"

## Distractor Quality (Wrong Answers)

Wrong answer options must be:
- **Plausible**: Real Azure services/features that exist and seem relevant
- **Clearly incorrect**: Fail to meet stated requirements when reasoning is applied
- **Educational**: Help reinforce understanding of when NOT to use certain services

Avoid:
- Obviously wrong answers (non-existent services, absurd configurations)
- Answers that could be "also correct" depending on interpretation
- Generic options that don't demonstrate understanding

## Formatting Rules

- Use `<br><br>` for line breaks in Front field (Anki HTML compatibility)
- Escape quotes in CSV: Use `"` for any quote inside a field
- Wrap entire field in quotes if it contains commas, quotes, or line breaks
- Tags: Space-separated, no special characters

## Quality Checklist (Apply to Every Flashcard)

✓ **Technical Accuracy**: Answer is definitively correct per official Azure documentation
✓ **No Ambiguity**: Only one answer can be defended as correct given the constraints
✓ **Valuable Extra**: Extra field provides insights beyond the answer explanation
✓ **Plausible Distractors**: Wrong answers are real services that seem relevant but fail requirements
✓ **Appropriate Tags**: Tags accurately reflect domain and topic
✓ **Diverse Structure**: Question phrasing and structure varies from previous cards

## Constraints

- Generate diverse questions - avoid repetitive patterns in structure or phrasing
- Every flashcard must test practical, exam-relevant knowledge
- Scenarios should include specific requirements/constraints that guide the solution
- Balance across different Azure service categories
- Anchor all question topics to the extracted official Microsoft exam guide domain/topic map
- Keep domain coverage proportional to official exam weighting (or skill-count fallback when weighting is not published)

## Self-Evaluation

After generating flashcards, review each against:

✓ Single defensible answer given the stated constraints
✓ All three distractors are plausible but clearly wrong
✓ Scenario includes relevant constraints (performance, cost, compliance, etc.)
✓ Extra field adds architectural insight or valuable comparison
✓ Tags accurately match content
✓ No duplicate concepts or overly similar question patterns
✓ Question topic exists in the extracted official exam guide domains/skills measured
✓ Domain distribution aligns with the planned weighted coverage

**Action**: Flag any flashcard that doesn't meet all standards and regenerate it before finalizing the output.

## Coverage Validation Checklist (Pre-Delivery)

✓ Extracted topic map includes all domains from the official Microsoft exam guide
✓ Flashcard distribution across domains follows official exam weighting (or skill-count fallback)
✓ Every domain in the official guide is represented by at least one flashcard
✓ No flashcards test topics outside the extracted official exam scope (unless user explicitly requests a focused subset)
✓ Tags map to extracted domain/topic names rather than invented categories

## Final Output

**File Naming Convention**: Save the CSV file with the current date in the filename using the format: `{exam_code}_flashcards_{YYYY-MM-DD}.csv` (e.g., `az305_flashcards_2026-02-06.csv`)

After generating the flashcards, provide clear import instructions:

### Anki Import Instructions

**To import the CSV file into Anki:**

1. **Open Anki** and select the deck where you want to import the cards (or create a new deck)

2. **Go to File → Import** (or press Ctrl+Shift+I / Cmd+Shift+I on Mac)

3. **Select the CSV file**: Navigate to and select the generated CSV file
   - Ensure the file is saved as plain text CSV in UTF-8 encoding

4. **Configure import settings**:
   - **Note Type**: Choose `Basic` if you only want Front/Back, or choose a custom note type with `Front`, `Back`, and `Extra` fields if you want the Extra column displayed on the back of the card
   - **Deck**: Select your target deck
   - **Fields separated by**: Comma
   - **Field mapping**: Map the CSV columns in this order:
     - Column 1 → Front
     - Column 2 → Back
     - Column 3 → Extra (only if the selected note type includes an `Extra` field)
     - Column 4 → Tags
   - **Allow HTML**: Enable the import option that allows HTML so `<br>` tags render as line breaks
   - **Note**: If you import into `Basic`, only `Front` and `Back` will be used. To preserve the `Extra` column, import into a note type that includes an `Extra` field.

5. **Click Import**

**Optional - Create Custom Note Type with Extra Field:**
- Tools → Manage Note Types → Add → Clone: Basic
- Name it "Flashcard with Extra" or similar
- Click "Fields" and add a field called "Extra"
- Click "Cards" and edit the back template to include `{{Extra}}` below the answer
- Example back template:
  ```
  {{FrontSide}}
  <hr id=answer>
  {{Back}}
  {{#Extra}}
  <br><br>
  <div style="color: #666; font-size: 90%;">{{Extra}}</div>
  {{/Extra}}
  ```

The Tags column will tag each note for easy filtering by exam, domain, or topic.
