You need to identify if the issue is in application code, database queries, or network latency between Azure services.<br><br>A) Enable Application Insights with distributed tracing and dependency tracking<br>B) Review VM CPU metrics in Azure Monitor<br>C) Analyze NSG flow logs for network traffic patterns","A) Enable Application Insights with distributed tracing and dependency tracking","Application Insights provides end-to-end transaction tracing with timing breakdown across application tiers, dependencies (SQL, HTTP), and components. Identifies bottlenecks. VM CPU metrics don't show application-level details. NSG flow logs track network flow, not application performance. Application Insights is the APM solution for performance troubleshooting.","AZ-104 Monitoring Performance"
"You need to automatically restart a VM if it becomes unresponsive to network requests for more than 5 minutes. The solution should not require custom scripts running inside the VM.<br><br>A) Configure Azure Monitor alert with auto-remediation action to restart VM<br>B) Enable Azure Automation Update Management<br>C) Use Azure Site Recovery for automatic failover","A) Configure Azure Monitor alert with auto-remediation action to restart VM","Monitor alerts support auto-remediation actions including VM restart via action groups with automation runbook or Logic App. Evaluates availability from outside VM (network probe). Update Management handles patching, not availability. ASR is for region-level DR. Monitor alert with remediation action provides self-healing infrastructure.","AZ-104 Monitoring Automation"
"Your security team requires 90-day retention of all administrative actions performed in Azure (who did what, when) across all subscriptions for compliance auditing.<br><br>A) Configure Activity Log diagnostic settings to send to Log Analytics workspace with 90-day retention<br>B) Enable Azure AD audit logs<br>C) Review Activity Log in Azure Portal (default 90-day retention)","A) Configure Activity Log diagnostic settings to send to Log Analytics workspace with 90-day retention","Activity Log captures control plane operations. Default portal retention is 90 days but better to send to Log Analytics for queries, long-term storage, and cross-subscription analysis. Azure AD audit logs track directory changes, not resource operations. Diagnostic settings ensure centralized, queryable audit trail meeting compliance requirements.","AZ-104 Monitoring Auditing"
