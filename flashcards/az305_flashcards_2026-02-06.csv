Cosmos DB doesn't have built-in full-text. SQL full-text lacks geo-spatial richness. Cognitive Search is purpose-built for complex search scenarios with low latency.","AZ-305 DataStorage DataIntegration"
"Your organization must store 1PB of compliance documents with versioning, legal hold preventing deletion during litigation, and audit trail of all access.<br><br>A) Azure Blob Storage with versioning, immutability policy (legal hold), and diagnostic logs<br>B) Azure Files with snapshots and RBAC<br>C) Azure Data Lake with ACLs","A) Azure Blob Storage with versioning, immutability policy (legal hold), and diagnostic logs","Blob versioning maintains document history, immutability legal hold prevents deletion/modification even by admins, diagnostic logs track all access. Files/Data Lake lack immutability. Blob immutability provides SEC 17a-4 compliance for long-term archival with legal hold and audit capabilities.","AZ-305 DataStorage BlobStorage"
"A database migration from on-premises Oracle to Azure requires minimal downtime with continuous replication during migration and ability to rollback if issues occur.<br><br>A) Azure Database Migration Service with online migration mode<br>B) Export/import with downtime window<br>C) Third-party replication tools","A) Azure Database Migration Service with online migration mode","DMS online mode provides continuous replication (CDC), minimal downtime cutover, pre-migration assessment and can maintain source until validated. Export/import requires extended downtime. Third-party adds complexity. DMS is Microsoft's managed migration service with online replication for Oracle to Azure SQL/PostgreSQL.","AZ-305 Infrastructure Migration"
"An application stores frequently accessed hot data (10GB) and large archival data (10TB). Hot data needs <10ms access, archival accessed once quarterly. Minimize costs while meeting performance requirements.<br><br>A) Azure Cache for Redis for hot data, Blob Storage Archive tier for archival<br>B) Cosmos DB for all data with different consistency levels<br>C) Premium SSD managed disks for all data","A) Azure Cache for Redis for hot data, Blob Storage Archive tier for archival","Redis provides sub-10ms for hot data, Archive tier minimizes cost for infrequent access with acceptable rehydration time. Single-tier solutions don't optimize for both patterns. Using appropriate storage tiers (Redis hot, Archive cold) balances performance and cost based on access patterns.","AZ-305 DataStorage NoSQL"
